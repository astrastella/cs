# CS

I decided to teach myself computer science. That's not a new decision of course. But in the past I always kind of tried to learn only the useful or most fun parts in a rush. This time the plan is to learn in depth, using openly available resources.

I am following the guide at [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

# OS

## Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces

This one is really good resource. Wish I could find as as good material for all the CS topics I am about to try. The dialogues gives a feeling of connection to the author, makes one feel he is _actually_ directly teaching them.

# Algorithms

## The Algorithm Design Manual

I've started reading [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/)
